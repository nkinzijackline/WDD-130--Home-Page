                    <h5>About Miraculous Tale</h5>
                    <p>
                        Miraculous Tale is a non-profit organization based in Masaka District in Uganda. The organization was formed
                        in the year 2005, following the many cries in Masaka, a district in Uganda. At that time, many people children, wives and husbands were getting lost on a daily basis in many families around the district.
                        As concerned citizens, we reached out to the authorities and managed to have them accept our bid to provide resources
                        in finding the lost individuals. We set up centers for counselling and providing hope for those who did not have any.
                        We managed to ensure a safe environment for the people after so many months of fighting. 
                        With so much success in that area, we thought we can continue to bring hope to many by setting up centers in Many
                        different places. It has been a meaningful life experience for us and many who have been helped. We could not
                        have done any better task  than being someone's miracle.
