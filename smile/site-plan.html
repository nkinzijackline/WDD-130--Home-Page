      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Have you ever imaged a world where you have no one 
          to turn to? Imagine our children wondering in the 
          desert of love? Feeble knees reaching the ground 
          for a glimpse of hope. You do not have to wonder 
          anymore with this new, Touch-Help website. The site
          has pages that can locate lost loved ones and bond us with those
          in situations very similar to ours. With one touch there are videos of
          hope and encouragement. This site has been designed to bring smile to
          your face on any smart device that you can access. It will have an open discussion 
          platform for those who would love a public opinion.
        </p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>This site will be targeting many who believe that 
          life is hard only for them, those who have given up 
          and think suicide is the only way out, the many who 
          have been separated from their loved ones and are seeking
          a platform to find them. In a nutshell, this website is for the young,
          middle-aged and old to find peace through a world of turmoil. It 
          is designed to reach over 2,000 people each day from all over the world.
          It will be written in English and translated in atleast 10 more different
          languages for many non-English speakers to have access.

      <h3>About us</h3>
      <p>
        Who we are:
          Miraculous Tale is a non-profit organization based in Masaka District in Uganda. The organization was formed
           in the year 2005, following the many cries in Masaka, a district in Uganda. At that time, many people children, wives and husbands were getting lost on a daily basis in many families around the district.
        As concerned citizens, we reached out to the authorities and managed to have them accept our bid to provide resources
        in finding the lost individuals. We set up centers for counselling and providing hope for those who did not have any.
        We managed to ensure a safe environment for the people after so many months of fighting. 
        With so much success in that area, we thought we can continue to bring hope to many by setting up centers in Many
        different places. It has been a meaningful life experience for us and many who have been helped. We could not
        have done any better task  than being someone's miracle.

        Esbert Mulony: He is a co-founder and currently the executive director of the organization. He has worked with many 
        human rights organizations and saw it fit to create one that reaches to individuals. He has been awarded many times
        for his relentless effort to bring a smile to people's faces
