      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Have you ever imaged a world where you have no one 
          to turn to? Imagine our children wondering in the 
          desert of love? Feeble knees reaching the ground 
          for a glimpse of hope. You do not have to wonder 
          anymore with this new, Touch-Help website. The site
          has pages that can locate lost loved ones and bond us with those
          in situations very similar to ours. With one touch there are videos of
          hope and encouragement. This site has been designed to bring smile to
          your face on any smart device that you can access. It will have an open discussion 
          platform for those who would love a public opinion.
        </p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>This site will be targeting many who believe that 
          life is hard only for them, those who have given up 
          and think suicide is the only way out, the many who 
          have been separated from their loved ones and are seeking
          a platform to find them. In a nutshell, this website is for the young,
          middle-aged and old to find peace through a world of turmoil. It 
          is designed to reach over 2,000 people each day from all over the world.
          It will be written in English and translated in atleast 10 more different
          languages for many non-English speakers to have access.
